Project: QA System with LlamaIndex and Google Gemini
This project showcases a Question Answering (QA) system built using LlamaIndex and Google Gemini embeddings, enabling efficient retrieval of answers based on user queries and a given dataset.

Overview
Goal: Develop a QA system that processes questions and retrieves relevant answers.
Tech Stack: Python, LlamaIndex, Google Gemini embeddings, LangChain, Git for version control.

Key Components:
Virtual environment setup (Anaconda/pip) and modular project structure.
.env file for managing API keys securely.
VS Code integration and automation scripts for streamlined development.
Multi-LLM integration (LlamaIndex, LangChain) for diverse query handling.
Configuration management using Settings.

Features
QA Functionality: Processes user queries and provides precise answers.
Multi-LLM Support: Integrates various language models for robust response.
Modular Structure: Automated setup and organized file management.

Future Enhancements
Next Steps: Explore text-to-text and image-to-text capabilities using advanced embedding models.
This repository is part of a series focused on AI application development, from setup to best practices.
